# RobloxBots
This script is just gonna be used as like you being able to control bots with Roblox exploits, this works with any executor, some might have issues but I don't know how to fix them so yeah!

# Commands
Here are the commands you use for the bot.
**cmds** - Shows most of the commands.
**credits** - Shows credits for the script.
**follow/unfollow** - Makes the bot move to you.
**say** - Anything after the word say it will say.
**sit** - Makes the bot sit.
**jump** - Makes the bot jump.
**render/dontrender** - Shows or hides bots screen to reduce lag.
